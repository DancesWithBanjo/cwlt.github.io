# cwlt.github.io

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple jumping-off point for a Jekyll-based github.io site.

## Initial Set-Up

### Prerequisites
  * git (a tutorial on installing git can be found [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git))
  * Jekyll (optional; get it [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

### Download
  
### Set Up github.io repository
  * Go to [github.com](https://www.github.com) to set yourself up an account if you don't have one already.
  * Once your account is set up, when you navigate to [github.com](https://www.github.com) you should see a link to create a `New Repository`.
  Click it.
  * Create a new repository called `username.github.io`, replacing `username` with your username.
  You should make this a public repository.

### Clone and Deploy the Template

 Replacing
 * You can share your resume by replacing `resources/resume.pdf` with your own.
 * Remember, after each change you make you will need to `git commit` the change and `git push master origin` to deploy it online.
 * Want to change the overall look of your site?
 You can find info about customizing your Jekyll theme at [jekyllrb.com](https://www.jekyllrb.com).
 * Want to preview changes to your site before you put it online?
 If you have Jekyll installed, you can run `jekyll serve` on the terminal from the project directory.
 Then, copy and paste the server address that is reported into your browser to view a locally-hosted version of your site.
